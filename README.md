# Sentia-Test
This application will work for both iPhone & iPad(Portrait & Landscpe mode).

For Premium and Standard data, i have made two different tab views.

on click of data, User will be redirected to its detail page which contains id as requested.

Also in iPad User will find data and it's detail side by side.
 
For iPhone app, User need to press back button first in order to see premium and standard data as SplitViewController by default shows detail view.

As Element I have used to develop this is SplitViewController and it works according to its default behaviour in iPhone and iPad.
